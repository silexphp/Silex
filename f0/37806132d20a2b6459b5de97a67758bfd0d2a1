This is a feature of Pimple. You should improve the Pimple documentation and link to it : http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/#modifying-services-after-definition

Linking to the Pimple documentation is indeed a much better idea.

So why are there descriptions of `factory` and `protect`? These are both also Pimple features.

Besides, the `extend` example is already on the Twig provider page. Some explanation of what `extend` is and does, seems appropriate to me.
