:raised_hands: just one question - would that be released as a new major version of Silex?

@hkdobrev 2.3.0 would be the version. I don't think we need a new major version here.

I totally agree with all of this, but is supporting only PHP 7.1 and above a little too much? I think we should support 7.0 because this is the version that comes with the latest Ubuntu LTS release wich is widely used on many hosting solutions, i.e. AWS.

@GBeushausen Symfony 4 requires PHP 7.1, so that's why I'm using 7.1+ here as well. And keep in mind that people can still use older Silex versions if they need to.

@fabpot Ah ok. Then of course this is the best solution.

Proud reader here üëç

@fabpot does this effectively mean that you want to keep the project alive under reduced maintenance?

Overall, reducing maintenance burden is a big win anyway, so this is a good idea.

@Ocramius I'm trying to make it easier for a new team to take over :)
