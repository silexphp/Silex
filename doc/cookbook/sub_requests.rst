How to make sub-requests
========================

Since Silex is based on the ``HttpKernelInterface``, it allows you to simulate
requests against your application. This means that you can embed a page within
another, it also allows you to forward a request which is essentially an
internal redirect that does not change the URL.

Basics
------

You can make a sub-request by calling the ``handle`` method on the
``Application``. This method takes three arguments:

* ``$request``: An instance of the ``Request`` class which represents the
   HTTP request.

* ``$type``: Must be either ``HttpKernelInterface::MASTER_REQUEST`` or
  ``HttpKernelInterface::SUB_REQUEST``. Certain listeners are only executed for
  the master request, so it's important that this is set to ``SUB_REQUEST``.

* ``$catch``: Catches exceptions and turns them into a response with status code
  ``500``. This argument defaults to ``true``. For sub-requests you will most
  likely want to set it to ``false``.

By calling ``handle``, you can make a sub-request manually. Here's an example::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernelInterface;

    $subRequest = Request::create('/');
    $response = $app->handle($subRequest, HttpKernelInterface::SUB_REQUEST, false);

There's some more things that you need to keep in mind though. In most cases
you will want to forward some parts of the current master request to the
sub-request. That includes: Cookies, server information, session.

Here is a more advanced example that forwards said information (``$request``
holds the master request)::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernelInterface;

    $subRequest = Request::create('/', 'GET', array(), $request->cookies->all(), array(), $request->server->all());
    if ($request->getSession()) {
        $subRequest->setSession($request->getSession());
    }

    $response = $app->handle($subRequest, HttpKernelInterface::SUB_REQUEST, false);

To forward this response to the client, you can simply return it from a
controller::

    use Silex\Application;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernelInterface;

    $app->get('/foo', function (Application $app, Request $request) {
        $subRequest = Request::create('/', ...);
        $response = $app->handle($subRequest, HttpKernelInterface::SUB_REQUEST, false);

        return $response;
    });

If you want to embed the response as part of a larger page you can call
``Response::getContent``::

    $header = ...;
    $footer = ...;
    $body = $response->getContent();

    return $header.$body.$footer;

Rendering pages in Twig templates
---------------------------------

The :doc:`TwigServiceProvider </providers/twig>` provides a ``render``
function that you can use in Twig templates. It gives you a convenient way to
embed pages.

.. code-block:: jinja

    {{ render('/sidebar') }}

For details, refer to the :doc:`TwigServiceProvider </providers/twig>` docs.

Edge Side Includes
------------------

You can use ESI either through the :doc:`HttpCacheServiceProvider
</providers/http_cache>` or a reverse proxy cache such as Varnish. This also
allows you to embed pages, however it also gives you the benefit of caching
parts of the page.

Here is an example of how you would embed a page via ESI:

.. code-block:: jinja

    <esi:include src="/sidebar" />

For details, refer to the :doc:`HttpCacheServiceProvider
</providers/http_cache>` docs.

Dealing with the request base URL
---------------------------------

One thing to watch out for is the base URL. If your application is not
hosted at the webroot of your web server, then you may have an URL like
``http://example.org/foo/index.php/articles/42``.

In this case, ``/foo/index.php`` is your request base path. Silex accounts for
this path prefix in the routing process, it reads it from
``$request->server``. In the context of sub-requests this can lead to issues,
because if you do not prepend the base path the request could mistake a part
of the path you want to match as the base path and cut it off.

You can prevent that from happening by always prepending the base path when
constructing a request::

    $url = $request->getUriForPath('/');
    $subRequest = Request::create($url, 'GET', array(), $request->cookies->all(), array(), $request->server->all());

This is something to be aware of when making sub-requests by hand.

Lack of container scopes
------------------------

While the sub-requests available in Silex are quite powerful, they have their
limits. The major limitation/danger that you will run into is the lack of
scopes on the Pimple container.

The container is a concept that is global to a Silex application, since the
application object **is** the container. Any request that is run against an
application will re-use the same set of services. Since these services are
mutable, code in a master request can affect the sub-requests and vice versa.
Any services depending on the ``request`` service will store the first request
that they get (could be master or sub-request), and keep using it, even if
that request is already over.

For example::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    class ContentFormatNegotiator
    {
        private $request;

        public function __construct(Request $request)
        {
            $this->request = $request;
        }

        public function negotiateFormat(array $serverTypes)
        {
            $clientAcceptType = $this->request->headers->get('Accept');

            ...

            return $format;
        }
    }

This example looks harmless, but it might blow up. You have no way of knowing
what ``$request->headers->get()`` will return, because ``$request`` could be
either the master request or a sub-request. The answer in this case is to pass
the request as an argument to ``negotiateFormat``. Then you can pass it in
from a location where you have safe access to the current request: a listener
or a controller.

Here are a few general approaches to working around this issue:

* Use ESI with Varnish.

* Do not inject the request, ever. Use listeners instead, as they can access
  the request without storing it.

* Inject the Silex Application and fetch the request from it.
