    After:

* **2012-07-15**: removed the ``monolog.configure`` service. Use the

            // do something
        });

    After::

        $app['monolog'] = $app->share($app->extend('monolog', function($monolog, $app) {
            // do something

            return $monolog;
        }));


* **2012-06-17**: ``ControllerCollection`` now takes a required route instance
  as a constructor argument.

        // or even better

        $app['twig.configure'] = $app->protect(function ($twig) use ($app) {
            // do something
        });

    After::

        $app['twig'] = $app->share($app->extend('twig', function($twig, $app) {
            // do something

            return $twig;
        }));

  renamed to ``Silex\Provider\TwigServiceProvider``).

* **2011-09-22**: The way reusable applications work has changed. The
  ``mount()`` method now takes an instance of ``ControllerCollection`` instead
  of an ``Application`` one.

    Before::

        $app = new Application();
        $app->get('/bar', function() { return 'foo'; });

        return $app;

    After::

        $app->get('/bar', function() { return 'foo'; });

        return $app;

* **2011-08-08**: The controller method configuration is now done on the Controller itself

    Before::

        $app->match('/', function () { echo 'foo'; }, 'GET|POST');

    After::

        $app->match('/', function () { echo 'foo'; })->method('GET|POST');
