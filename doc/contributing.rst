Contributing
============

We are open to contributions to the Silex code. If you find
a bug or want to contribute a provider, just follow these
steps.

* Fork `the Silex repository <https://github.com/fabpot/Silex>`_
  on github.

* Make your feature addition or bug fix.

* Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.

* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

If you have a big change or would like to discuss something,
please join us on the `mailing list
<http://groups.google.com/group/silex-php>`_.
