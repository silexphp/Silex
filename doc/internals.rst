Internals
=========

This chapter will tell you a bit about how Silex works
internally.

Silex
-----

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

The application is the main interface to Silex. It
implements Symfony2's `HttpKernelInterface
<http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/HttpKernelInterface.html>`_,
so you can pass a `Request
<http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.html>`_
to the ``handle`` method and it will return a `Response
<http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Response.html>`_.

It extends the ``Pimple`` service container, allowing
for flexibility on the outside as well as the inside. you
could replace any service, and you are also able to read
them.

The application makes strong use of the `EventDispatcher
<http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/EventDispatcher/EventDispatcher.html>`_
to hook into the Symfony2 HttpKernel events. This allows
fetching the ``Request``, converting string responses into
``Response`` objects and handling Exceptions. We also use it
to dispatch some custom events like before/after filters and
errors.

Controller
~~~~~~~~~~

The Symfony2 `Route
<http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/Routing/Route.html>`_
is actually quite powerful. Routes
can be named, which allows for URL generation. They can
also have requirements for the variable parts. In order
to allow settings these through a nice interface the
``match`` method (which is used by ``get``, ``post``, etc.)
returns an instance of the ``Controller``, which wraps
a route.

ControllerCollection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the goals of exposing the `RouteCollection
<http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/Routing/RouteCollection.html>`_
was to make it mutable, so extensions could add stuff to it.
The challenge here is the fact that routes know nothing
about their name. The name only has meaning in context
of the ``RouteCollection`` and cannot be changed.

To solve this challenge we came up with a staging area
for routes. The ``ControllerCollection`` holds the
controllers until ``flush`` is called, at which point
the routes are added to the ``RouteCollection``. Also,
the controllers are then frozen. This means that they can
no longer be modified and will throw an Exception if
you try to do so.

Unfortunately no good way for flushing implicitly
could be found, which is why flushing is now always
explicit. The Application will flush, but if you want
to read the ``ControllerCollection`` before the
request takes place, you will have to call flush
yourself.

The ``Application`` provides a shortcut ``flush``
method for flushing the ``ControllerCollection``.

Symfony2
--------

Following Symfony2 components are used by Silex:

* **ClassLoader**: For autoloading classes.

* **HttpFoundation**: For ``Request`` and ``Response``.

* **HttpKernel**: Because we need a heart.

* **Routing**: For matching defined routes.

* **EventDispatcher**: For hooking into the HttpKernel.
