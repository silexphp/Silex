Introduction
============

Silex is a PHP microframework. It is built on the shoulders of `Symfony2`_ and
`Pimple`_ and also inspired by `Sinatra`_.

Silex aims to be:

* *Concise*: Silex exposes an intuitive and concise API.

* *Extensible*: Silex has an extension system based around the Pimple
  service-container that makes it easy to tie in third party libraries.

* *Testable*: Silex uses Symfony's HttpKernel which abstracts request and
  response. This makes it very easy to test apps and the framework itself. It
  also respects the HTTP specification and encourages its proper use.

In a nutshell, you define controllers and map them to routes, all in one step.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    // web/index.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

    $app = new Silex\Application();

    $app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) {
        return 'Hello '.$app->escape($name);
    });

    $app->run();

All that is needed to get access to the Framework is to include the
autoloader.

Next, a route for ``/hello/{name}`` that matches for ``GET`` requests is
defined. When the route matches, the function is executed and the return value
is sent back to the client.

Finally, the app is run. Visit ``/hello/world`` to see the result. It's really
that easy!
